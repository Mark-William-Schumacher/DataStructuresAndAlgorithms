# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
Practice for technical interviews, done in preparation for onsite interviews during winter of 2015

These are technical interview prep questions taken from Elements of a Programming interview http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/pdf/epi-light-1.4.10.pdf and leetcode.com

GlobalAndLocalAlignment.java have some tester code written to solve some small scale dynamic programming local/global alignment problems. Algorythm is O(nm) space / time. 
Todo - Can be done in O(n) space at not cost to time with a clever solution
